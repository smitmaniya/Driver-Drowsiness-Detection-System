Project Definition :-
The project involves designing an automated system to detect driver drowsiness using OpenCV and Python, aiming to prevent accidents caused by drowsy driving. It focuses on monitoring the driver's eye blink patterns to identify signs of fatigue. This technology is crucial as drowsiness is responsible for about 20% of road accidents, and developing effective detection systems is vital for enhancing road safety.

Software and Hardware Requirements :-
Hardware Requirements
· camera

Software Requirements

· python version 3.6

· pycharm

Library’s Used

· Open CV

· Dlib

· Numpy

· Pygame

Objective:-
· The main objective is to first design a system to detect driver’s drowsiness by continuously monitoring retina of the eye.

· Nowadays the driver safety in the car is one of the most required system to avoid accidents.

· Our objective of the project is to ensure the safety system .

· For enhancing the safety ,we are detecting the eye blinks of the driver and estimating then driver safety and control the car accordingly.

· To alert the driver on the detection of drowsiness by using buzzer or alarm.

Traffic management can be maintained by reducing the accidents

Limitations :-
· This Project can’t be implemented using python version above or below 3.6. Because the Dlib Library is only supported in Python version 3.6.

· If we use Python version above or below 3.6 , then this project will not run.
